Wear OS Sample
===================================

This sample uses the [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/)
to display a map on Wear OS. It shows the basic setup required for a
gradle-based Android Studio project that [supports ambient mode](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/always-on.html).

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v31
- Latest Android Build Tools
- Wear OS emulator or device

Getting Started
---------------

This sample use the Gradle build system.

First download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)

In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or
"Import Project" option. Next select the ApiDemos/ directory that you downloaded
from this repository.
If prompted for a gradle configuration accept the default settings.

Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.

Add your API key to the `local.properties` file and call it `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
See the [quick guide to getting an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup).
