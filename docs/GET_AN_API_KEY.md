# Getting an API Key

The demos found in this repository require an API key. To create and use an API key:

  1. [Get a Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key)
  1. Open the file in the root directory of the sample called `local.properties` (by default, this file is **NOT** under version control)
  1. Add a single line to `local.properties` that looks like `MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`, where `YOUR_API_KEY` is the API key you obtained in the first step
  1. Build and run
